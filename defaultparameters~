#  List of trial apertures for aperture-corrected photometry [pixels]   
#    these should be smaller than the largest star's aperture
0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,15

#  Background : inner annulus [pixels]   
#    should be at least 1 more than largest trial aperture
15

#  Background : outer annulus [pixels]   
#    should at least 1 more than inner annulus, but preferably less than min separation distance between sources
20

#  Centroid box size [pixels]   
#    it should preferably not exceed the maximum trial aperture or minimum separation distance between sources
15

#  Maximum shift for centroid [pixels]   
#    it should not exceed the minimum separation distance between sources
5

#  Minimum distance for sources from the edge [pixels]   
#    only used to eliminate edge sources if more than 10 sources are found
20

#  Minimum separation distance between sources [pixels] 
#    only used if you want to eliminate crowding if more than 10 sources are found  
10

#  The maximum magnitude error permitted [mag] for aperture-corrected photometry   
#    points are ignorred if MagErr > this max limit
0.1

#  The maximum frame-to-frame drift allowed for centroids [pixels]  
#    should not exceed the minimum separation distance between extracted sources
3

#  The FWHM of the PSF [pixels]
#    is 3 for good sampling and 1 for severe under-sampling (ideal sampling is PSF FWHM ~ 2.333 pixels)
